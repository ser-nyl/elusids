  "notes": "TripSit does not host a 3‑FMA factsheet at this time; information is pieced together from general stimulant HR guidance, TripSit’s combo chart, and 3‑FMA user threads. Combining amphetamines with MAOIs can precipitate hypertensive crises and is widely regarded as dangerous; avoid entirely. Mixing with MDMA, cocaine, or other stimulants increases cardiovascular strain and neurotoxic risk; avoid such combinations. DXM and tramadol combinations add seizure and serotonin‑toxicity risk; avoid. Alcohol and GHB/GBL can mask intoxication and increase dehydration/respiratory risks as stimulant effects wane—set firm limits or avoid mixing. Expect typical stimulant adverse effects (tachycardia, hypertension, appetite suppression, insomnia, anxiety); those with cardiovascular disease or on interacting meds should abstain. Bruxism/jaw clenching and nystagmus are commonly reported with stimulants; gum/mouthguard and magnesium may help, but dose control is primary. Compulsive redosing is a known stimulant risk; pre‑measure single doses and secure the remainder. If using, prioritise sleep, nutrition, and electrolyte hydration during and after; plan a stimulant‑free recovery day to mitigate comedown mood dip. Never inject research chemicals; sterility, solubility, and excipient unknowns make parenteral routes especially risky. Use drug‑checking services where available; identity/purity of ‘3‑FMA’ has historically varied in the unregulated market. Long‑term neurotoxicity data are absent; adopt conservative frequency (e.g., weeks between sessions) and avoid multi‑day runs.",
